# Challenge-1
You want your program to be usable internationally and the purchasing age is different for different countries.
These are the minimum ages: (for beer)
Germany: 16
South Africa: 18
USA: 21
Change your program, so that it asks for the country of the user and for their age. (as two separate inputs)
Based on the inputs the user gave, the program should decide what to do.
your ageCheck function header should then look like this: ageCheck(age: Int, country: String): Boolean
If the user enters any country that the program does not know, it should say that we are not selling alcohol to unknown locations.
